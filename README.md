This repo serves as a template for any webdev project I decide to work on.

Some benefits include:

* Auto-reloading on save
* Uses browser-sync, so you can view it on multiple browsers easily
* HTML preprocessing to append/prepend header/footer
* Ability to have a JS preprocessor (same with CSS)
* Configurable subdirectories for JS/CSS/Misc
